# caver.js

caver.js is a JavaScript API library that allows developers to interact with a
Klaytn node using a HTTP or Websocket connection.  It is available on npm.

To try it out, install caver-js with npm like following command:

```
$ npm install caver-js
```

Note that `package.json` file should exist on the same install path.  If it
does not exist, `package.json` should be generated via `npm init`.


## API Specification

The API lists of caver.js are described in folloinwg links:

## Error Code Improvement

The error messages from Ethereum via web3.js are hardly figuring out where the
error occurs.  caver.js improves the interface to catch error messages from
Klaytn.

More details can be found in the value of `txError` of the transaction receipt
like the below:

```
Error: runtime error occurred in interpreter

The meaning of error code can be found below:

```
{

  "0x3": 'max call depth exceeded',
  "0x4": 'contract address collision',
  "0x5": 'contract creation code storage out of gas',
